Privacy Policy
This application (hereinafter referred to as "the App") respects and protects the privacy of its users. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard user information.

1. Data Collection
The App itself does not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable user information (such as name, email, or contact details).

However, in order to provide indoor positioning functionality, the App integrates a third-party SDK, com.mist:core-sdk, which may collect certain technical data necessary for its services, including:

Bluetooth beacon signal information (UUID, RSSI)

Wi-Fi data (e.g., SSID, BSSID)

Device identifiers (e.g., Android ID)

Approximate or precise location (depending on granted permissions)

This information is used solely for positioning and diagnostic purposes and is not used to identify individual users.

2. Permission Usage
To enable indoor positioning, the App may request the following permissions:

Location permissions (ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION / ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION): Required by Android to perform Bluetooth scans.

Bluetooth permissions (BLUETOOTH, BLUETOOTH_ADMIN, BLUETOOTH_SCAN, BLUETOOTH_CONNECT): Used to scan for nearby beacons.

These permissions are used only for indoor positioning purposes and are not used for any other purpose.

3. Third-Party SDK: Mist Core SDK
The App integrates the Mist Core SDK provided by Juniper Networks (com.mist:core-sdk) to enable indoor location services.

Please refer to Mistâ€™s official privacy policy to understand how they handle data:

4. Data Storage and Sharing
The App does not store any user information on our own servers, nor does it share any data with third parties.
All location-related data is handled solely by the Mist SDK, in accordance with their privacy policy.

5. Children's Privacy
The App is not designed for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal data from children.

6. Policy Updates
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time due to changes in functionality. All updates will be posted on this page with the effective date indicated.
